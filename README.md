# Welcome

This project has been created to explore some initial thoughts and ideas when working with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)

## Getting started

Let's create an app using `npx` to run the latest Gatsby CLI:

```sh
$ npx gatsby new app
```

To run the app, simply run the `start` script in either the root directory or the `app` directory:

```sh
$ npm start
```

The app should be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The GraphiQL IDE should be available at [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)
